# NOTES
## From the GitHub Lesson

This was mostly just redoing what I already knew about, with `git pull` and most of the other `git` commands
most of the markdown for a `.md` file follows the syntax of a discord markdown message, funnily enough.
outside of that though, there is \*this* for *italics*, \*\*this** for **bold**, 3 stars for both, and then back tics for code.
back ticks also allow seeing colors in the form of hex values, RGB(), or HSL() formats.
Links follow the convention of brackets for the text that wants to show up, followed by parentheses, like this \[]\()

there are many, many other markdown notations found by going to [this site](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
